# To-Do-List
My todo application is built with Express on the backend and a frontend user interface. It is connected to a MongoDB database using Mongoose for data storage and retrieval. Users can create, update, and delete their todo items through the user-friendly interface, and the backend handles the logic and communication with the database.
